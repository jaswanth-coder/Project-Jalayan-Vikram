This file is for cad mmodels . and designs

Based on different videos and resources what we have observed is for  machine development . 

the rotators are called screw pontoons

while going forward or backward on land/terrain 
considering the 4 wheeled screw wheels 
1. from one side like consider car front and back wheels , 
    they are mirror images on both sides so in my opinion to cancel out divergent motion from straight path. But to rotate , 
    to go left ==> right side screw wheel has to rotate
    to go right ==> left side screw wheel has to rotate

2. In water , 
    They are going in a path using these 4 rotational helix screws .
    motion which was observed is two front screws rotate in opposite directions 
    and backward motors also opposite to front ones in the body build. But i guess they are also moving in the same direction as well as front motors.
