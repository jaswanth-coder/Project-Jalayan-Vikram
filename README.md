# Project Planning 
------------------------------
## Planning Step by Step 


Developing a flood rescue robot prototype in two months is an ambitious goal, but with careful planning and efficient execution, it's possible. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this within your timeframe:

*Timeline: Developing a Flood Rescue Robot Prototype*

Week 1: Planning and Initial Development
1. *Define Requirements:*
   - Outline specifications, payload capacity, and communication range.
2. *Research:*
   - Investigate existing technologies and similar projects.

Week 1: Component Selection, Design, and Software Setup
3. *Select Components:*
   - Choose hardware components considering water resistance.
4. *Chassis Design:*
   - Create a preliminary design for the robot's chassis.
5. *Software Development Setup:*
   - Set up the development environment and choose programming language.
6. *Simulator Selection and Setup:*
   - Choose a simulator and start simple simulations.

Week 2: Prototyping and Basic Testing
7. *Build Prototype:*
   - Assemble the robot prototype based on chosen components.
8. *Basic Navigation and Control:*
   - Develop basic software for controlling movements and test in the simulator.

Week 3: Advanced Features, Payload Delivery, and Comprehensive Testing
9. *Add Advanced Features:*
   - Implement obstacle avoidance, GPS navigation, and communication.
10. *Payload Delivery Mechanism:*
    - Integrate the mechanism for delivering supplies and test.
11. *Comprehensive Testing:*
    - Conduct extensive testing in simulated flood conditions.

Week 4: Documentation and Presentation
12. *Documentation:*
    - Document design, components, code, and testing procedures.
13. *Prepare Presentation:*
    - Create a compelling presentation highlighting features and benefits.
14. *Iterate and Optimize:*
    - Address identified issues, optimize performance, and make improvements.

Week 4 : Final Refinements
15. *Final Testing:*
    - Conduct a final round of testing to ensure all improvements are effective.
16. *Documentation Review:*
    - Review and finalize all documentation for submission.
17. *Prepare for Presentation:*
    - Practice the presentation and ensure clarity.

This one-month plan provides a structured timeline for each phase of the Flood Rescue Robot development, ensuring a systematic approach from planning to final refinements.
