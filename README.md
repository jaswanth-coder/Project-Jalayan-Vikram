# Project Planning 
------------------------------
## Planning Step by Step 


Developing a flood rescue robot prototype in two months is an ambitious goal, but with careful planning and efficient execution, it's possible. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this within your timeframe:

### Month 1: Planning and Initial Development

#### Week 1-2: Define Requirements and Research
1. **Define Requirements:**
   - Clearly outline the specifications and requirements for your flood rescue robot. Identify the key features, payload capacity, and communication range.

2. **Research:**
   - Investigate existing technologies, components, and simulators. Learn about similar projects and understand the challenges they faced.

#### Week 3-4: Component Selection and Design
3. **Select Components:**
   - Choose the hardware components such as motors, sensors, microcontrollers, communication modules, and power sources. Consider the environmental conditions, especially water resistance.

4. **Chassis Design:**
   - Create a preliminary design for the robot's chassis, taking into account the chosen components and payload requirements.

#### Week 5-6: Software and Simulation Setup
5. **Software Development Setup:**
   - Set up the development environment, choose the programming language, and install necessary software tools.

6. **Simulator Selection and Setup:**
   - Choose a simulator (e.g., Gazebo) and set it up for your robot. Start simple simulations to ensure compatibility and understand the basics.

### Month 2: Prototyping and Testing

#### Week 1-2: Prototyping
7. **Build Prototype:**
   - Assemble the robot prototype based on the chosen components and chassis design. Ensure that the hardware fits together and functions properly.

8. **Basic Navigation and Control:**
   - Develop basic software for controlling the robot's movements and test it in the simulator. Ensure that the robot can navigate in a controlled environment.

#### Week 3-4: Advanced Features and Testing
9. **Add Advanced Features:**
   - Implement advanced features such as obstacle avoidance, GPS navigation, and communication with the central control system.

10. **Payload Delivery Mechanism:**
    - Integrate the mechanism for delivering water, food, and medical packages. Test the payload delivery system.

11. **Comprehensive Testing:**
    - Conduct extensive testing in simulated flood conditions. Test the robot's performance, reliability, and safety features.

#### Final Week: Documentation and Presentation
12. **Documentation:**
    - Document the design, components, code, and testing procedures. Prepare detailed documentation that can be presented to judges or competition organizers.

13. **Prepare Presentation:**
    - Create a compelling presentation highlighting the features, capabilities, and benefits of your flood rescue robot. Practice your presentation to ensure clarity and coherence.

14. **Iterate and Optimize:**
    - Use the final week to address any issues identified during testing. Optimize the robot's performance and make any necessary improvements.
